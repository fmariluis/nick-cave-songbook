# Nick Cave Songbook
Just some nicely formatted collection of Nick Cave's lyrics, using `LaTeX`. All lyrics taken from https://www.nickcave.com/lyrics/

Note: the license in this repo applies only to the LaTeX code, I certainly don't have any rights over Nick Cave's lyrics :)

## How to build your own PDF
You'll need some TeX distribution. Personally, I built this using TeXLive (https://tug.org/texlive/) on MacOS and the LaTeX Workshop extension for VSCode.
